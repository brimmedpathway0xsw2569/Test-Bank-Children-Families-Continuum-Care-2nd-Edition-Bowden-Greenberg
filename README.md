It shows students how to make critical judgments and assessments to manage the care of children in a variety of community settings, including homes, schools, and medical centers. From infancy through adolescence, this text thoroughly covers the health promotion, surveillance, and maintenance needs of children. In this edition, threaded case studies follow a community of pediatric clients and continue throughout the chapter to show the interrelated dynamics of pediatric nursing care.
